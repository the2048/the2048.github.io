When life gives you lemons, you'd obviously think to make lemonade of them, right?<br>
Some would make life take the lemons back.<br>
Others would just sit around and suck on them.<br>
A few more, for example, might try and offload them onto others.<br>
For me, that's okay.<br>
Having the proverbial lemons being offloaded to me? I'm okay with it.<br>
So whatever it might be, always remember that you've got someone there willing to listen to you.<br>
You may not trust them, however to push off the so-called solution, you must.<br>
Remember; as long as I know you, and you're part of my friend group, I love you.<br>
Any of you.<br>
